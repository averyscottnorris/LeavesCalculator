Briefly Title I of the ADA \n Helps people with disabilities access the same employment opportunities and benefits available to people without disabilities. \n Applies to employers with 15 or more employees. \n Requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants or employees. A “reasonable accommodation” is a change that accommodates employees with disabilities so they can do the job without causing the employer “undue hardship” (too much difficulty or expense). \n Defines disability, establishes guidelines for the reasonable accommodation process, and addresses medical examinations and inquiries. \n Regulated and enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
